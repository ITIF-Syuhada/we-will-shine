## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Design Principles:**

**1. Privacy by Design**

```typescript
// Default: Maximum privacy
const DEFAULT_SETTINGS = {
	chatMode: 'anonymous', // No identity by default
	dataSharing: 'none', // Opt-in, not opt-out
	encryption: 'E2EE', // End-to-end encrypted
	retention: '6months', // Auto-delete old data
	aiDataSharing: false, // Never send to AI providers
	trackingCookies: false // No tracking ever
};
```

**2. Modular & Extensible**

```

│   ├── mental-health/ # Curhat & wellbeing

## 📊 Data Philosophy

### **What We Collect (With Consent):**

**Tier 1: Anonymous Aggregated (Default)**

```typescript
{
  schoolId: 'hashed',
  month: '2025-10',
  totalStudents: 300,
  avgMoodScore: 7.2,
  topConcerns: ['academic', 'social', 'family'],
  crisisCount: 2  // No individual details
}
```

**Tier 2: Individual (Opt-in with Parent Consent)**

```typescript
{
  studentId: 'encrypted',
  personalityType: 'INFJ',
  strengths: ['creative', 'empathetic'],
  concerns: ['perfectionism'],
  moodTrend: [7, 6, 8, 7, 5],  // Last 5 days
  riskLevel: 'low',

  // Encrypted, only BK with permission can decrypt
  journalEntries: 'encrypted_blob',
  chatHistory: 'encrypted_blob'
}
```

**Tier 3: Crisis Mode (Automatic)**

```typescript
{
  alertId: 'uuid',
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  severity: 'high',
  keywords: ['detected crisis words'],

  // Immediate notification to:
  - Guru BK (SMS + Email + Dashboard)
  - Hotline (if enabled)
  - Parent (if configured)

  // Student can still remain anonymous to classmates
}
```
